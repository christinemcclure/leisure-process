It is a creed that has allowed him to follow his own passions, establish his own identity, and reap his own successes. Today's society, Buffett posits, has begun to replace a work ethic, relishing what you do, with a wealth ethic, honoring the payoff instead of the process. Yet, by focusing more on substance and less on reward, we can open doors of opportunity and strive toward a greater sense of fulfillment. Our journey in life rarely follows a straight line but is often met with false starts, crises, and blunders. How we push through and persevere is where we begin to create the life of our dreams--from discovering our vocations, to living out our bliss, to giving back to others.--From publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Conduct of life."],"2":["Values."],"3":["Children of the rich","United States","Biography."],"4":["Composers","United States","Biography."]}},

As the pace of our lives becomes faster and faster, we have to do so more often and more quickly. But are our predictions any good? Is there hope for improvement? In this book the author examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. Many predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. We are wired to detect a signal, and we mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the prediction paradox: the more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, and the more we are willing to learn from our mistakes, the more we can turn information into knowledge and data into foresight. The author examines both successes and failures to determine what more accurate forecasters have in common. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, he visits innovative forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. Even when their innovations are modest, we can learn from their methods. How can we train ourselves to think probabilistically, as they do? How can the insights of an eighteenth-century Englishman unlock the twenty-first-century challenges of global warming and terrorism? How can being smarter about the future help us make better decisions in the present?","subjects":{"1":["Forecasting."],"2":["Forecasting","Methodology."],"3":["Forecasting","History."],"4":["Bayesian statistical decision theory."],"5":["Knowledge, Theory of."],"6":["(DE-588)4144220-9","(DE-603)085569240","Bayes-Entscheidungstheorie","gnd"],"7":["(DE-588)4047390-9","(DE-603)085132160","Prognose","gnd"]}},

Every year millions of Americans celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but they may not be aware of how great an influence St. Patrick was on the subsequent history of civilization. Not only did he bring Christianity to Ireland, he instilled a sense of literacy and learning that would create the conditions that allowed Ireland to become \"the isle of saints and scholars\"--And thus preserve Western culture while Europe was being overrun by barbarians. In this entertaining and compelling narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Europe evolved from the classical age of Rome to the medieval era. Without Ireland, the transition could not have taken place. Not only did Irish monks and scribes maintain the very record of Western civilization -- copying manuscripts of Greek and Latin writers, both pagan and Christian, while libraries and learning on the continent were forever lost -- they brought their uniquely Irish world-view to the task. As Cahill delightfully illustrates, so much of the liveliness we associate with medieval culture has its roots in Ireland. When the seeds of culture were replanted on the European continent, it was from Ireland that they were germinated. In the tradition of Barbara Tuchman's A Distant Mirror, How The Irish Saved Civilization reconstructs an era that few know about but which is central to understanding our past and our cultural heritage. But it conveys its knowledge with a winking wit that aptly captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilization.","subjects":{"1":["Learning and scholarship","History","Medieval, 500-1500."],"2":["Civilization, Classical","Study and teaching","Ireland."],"3":["Books","History","400-1450."],"4":["Books","Ireland","History","400-1450."],"5":["Manuscripts","Ireland","History."],"6":["Monastic libraries","Ireland."],"7":["Transmission of texts."],"8":["Scriptoria","Ireland."],"9":["Savoir et eÃÅrudition","Histoire","500-1500 (Moyen AÃÇge)"],"10":["Civilisation ancienne","EÃÅtude et enseignement","Irlande."],"11":["Livres","Irlande","Histoire","400-1400."],"12":["Manuscrits","Irlande","Histoire."],"13":["BibliotheÃÄques de monasteÃÄres","Irlande."],"14":["Transmission de textes."],"15":["Scriptoriums","Irlande."],"16":["Cultuur.","gtt"],"17":["HistoÃÅria da europa (civilizacÃßaÃÉo)","Irlanda.","larpcal"],"18":["Manuscritos (histoÃÅria)","Irlanda.","larpcal"]}},

However, what lay before him was a physical gauntlet unlike anything he had encountered before: thousands of miles of open ocean, a small raft, and no food or water.

With their unique perspectives, Detectives King and Cooper evaluate evidence that has long been overlooked by specialists in Egyptology and archaeology. After considering natural causes, accident, and suicide, the authors come to the conclusion that Tut's death was most likely a murder.","subjects":{"1":["Forensic sciences."]}},
  {"isbn":"9780316001922","author":"Schiff, Stacy","title":"Cleopatra : a life ","summary":"\"Her palace shimmered with onyx, garnet, and gold, but was richer still in political and sexual intrigue. Above all else, Cleopatra was a shrewd strategist and an ingenious negotiator. She was married twice, each time to a brother. She waged a brutal civil war against the first when both were teenagers. She poisoned the second. Ultimately she dispensed with an ambitious sister as well; incest and assassination were family specialties. Cleopatra appears to have had sex with only two men. They happen, however, to have been Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, among the most prominent Romans of the day. Both were married to other women. Cleopatra had a child with Caesar and -- after his murder -- three more with his proteÃÅgeÃÅ. Already she was the wealthiest ruler in the Mediterranean; the relationship with Antony confirmed her status as the most influential woman of her age. The two would together attempt to forge a new empire, in an alliance that spelled their ends. Cleopatra has lodged herself in our imagination ever since. ... Along the way, Cleopatra's supple personality and the drama of her circumstances have been lost. In a ... return to the classical sources, Stacy Schiff ... separates fact from fiction to rescue the magnetic queen whose death ushered in a new world order.\"-- From book jacket.","subjects":{"1":["Queens","Egypt","Biography."]}},
  {"isbn":"9780307406620","author":"Meyer, Dick","title":"Why we hate us : American discontent in the new millennium","summary":"Here, journalist Meyer nails America's early-twenty-first-century mood disorder. He points out the most widespread symptoms, including the belligerence of partisan politics that perverts our democracy, the decline of once common manners, the vulgarity of Hollywood entertainment, the superficiality and untrustworthiness of the news media, the cult of celebrity, and the disappearance of authentic neighborhoods and voluntary organizations (the kind that have actual meetings where one can hobnob instead of just clicking in an online contribution). Meyer argues that when the social, spiritual, and political turmoil that followed the sixties collided with the technological and media revolution at the turn of the century, something inside us hit overload: our culture no longer reflects our own values. As a result, we are now morally and existentially tired, disoriented, anchorless, and defensive. The author also offers an uplifting prescription for breaking out of our current morass and learning how to hate us less.--From publisher description.","subjects":{"1":["Political culture","United States."],"2":["Popular culture","United States."],"3":["Civilization.","fast","(OCoLC)fst00862898"],"4":["Political culture.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01069263"],"5":["Popular culture.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01071344"],"6":["Social history.","fast","(OCoLC)fst01122498"]}},

Asim pinpoints Thomas Jefferson as the source of our enduring image: in a seminal but now obscure essay, he marshaled a welter of pseudo-science to define the stereotype of a shiftless child-man with huge appetites and stunted self control. Asim reveals how nineteenth-century \"science\" then colluded with popular culture to amplify this slander. What began as false generalizations became institutionalized in every corner of our society. Asim argues that even when uttered with the opposite intent by hipsters and hip-hop icons, using the slur helps keep blacks at the bottom of America's socio-economic ladder. But, he also shows, there is a place for this word in the mouths and on the pens of those who truly understand its twisted history.

Bush, weaving together social, cultural, political, economic, and international developments. We meet the era's many memorable figures--most notably, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton--and explore the \"culture wars\" where liberals and conservatives appeared to cut the country in two. Patterson describes how, when the Cold War finally ended, Americans faced bewildering new developments around the world. In exploring a wide range of cultural, social, and economic concerns, he shows how the persistence of racial tensions, high divorce rates, alarm over crime, and urban decay all led many writers to portray this era as one of decline. But he argues that our often unmet expectations caused many of us to view the era negatively, when in fact we were in many ways better off than we thought.--From publisher description.","subjects":{}},
