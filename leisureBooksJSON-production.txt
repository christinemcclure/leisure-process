Never mind how popular you are when you hand out the Watchtower instead of candy at Halloween. When Abrahams turned eighteen, things got even stranger. That's when she found herself married to a man she didn't love, with adultery her only way out. \"Disfellowshipped\" and exiled from the only world she'd ever known, Abrahams realized that the only people who could save her were the very sinners she had prayed would be smitten by God's wrath. Raucously funny, deeply unsettling, and written with scorching wit and deep compassion, I'm Perfect, You're Doomed explores the ironic absurdity of growing up believing that nothing matters because everything's about to be destroyed\"--Cover, p. 2.","subjects":{"1":["Jehovah's Witnesses","United States","Biography."]}},

{"isbn":"9781594204111","title":"The signal and the noise : why so many predictions fail--but some don't","author":"Nate Silver","summary":"Human beings have to make plans and strategize for the future. As the pace of our lives becomes faster and faster, we have to do so more often and more quickly. But are our predictions any good? Is there hope for improvement? In this book the author examines the world of prediction, investigating how we can distinguish a true signal from a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. Many predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. We are wired to detect a signal, and we mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the prediction paradox: the more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, and the more we are willing to learn from our mistakes, the more we can turn information into knowledge and data into foresight. The author examines both successes and failures to determine what more accurate forecasters have in common. In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, he visits innovative forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. Even when their innovations are modest, we can learn from their methods. How can we train ourselves to think probabilistically, as they do? How can the insights of an eighteenth-century Englishman unlock the twenty-first-century challenges of global warming and terrorism? How can being smarter about the future help us make better decisions in the present?","subjects":{"1":["Forecasting."],"2":["Forecasting","Methodology."],"3":["Forecasting","History."],"4":["Bayesian statistical decision theory."],"5":["Knowledge, Theory of."]}},

Asim pinpoints Thomas Jefferson as the source of our enduring image: in a seminal but now obscure essay, he marshaled a welter of pseudo-science to define the stereotype of a shiftless child-man with huge appetites and stunted self control. Asim reveals how nineteenth-century \"science\" then colluded with popular culture to amplify this slander. What began as false generalizations became institutionalized in every corner of our society. Asim argues that even when uttered with the opposite intent by hipsters and hip-hop icons, using the slur helps keep blacks at the bottom of America's socio-economic ladder. But, he also shows, there is a place for this word in the mouths and on the pens of those who truly understand its twisted history.

Historian Goodwin illuminates Lincoln's political genius, as the one-term congressman rises from obscurity to prevail over three gifted rivals to become president. When Lincoln emerged as the victor at the Republican National Convention, his rivals were dismayed. Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery led inexorably to civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was because of his extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires. It was this that enabled Lincoln to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union.","subjects":{"1":["Political leadership","United States","Case studies."],"2":["Genius","Case studies."],"3":["Presidents","United States","Biography."]}},

Bush, weaving together social, cultural, political, economic, and international developments. We meet the era's many memorable figures--most notably, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton--and explore the \"culture wars\" where liberals and conservatives appeared to cut the country in two. Patterson describes how, when the Cold War finally ended, Americans faced bewildering new developments around the world. In exploring a wide range of cultural, social, and economic concerns, he shows how the persistence of racial tensions, high divorce rates, alarm over crime, and urban decay all led many writers to portray this era as one of decline. But he argues that our often unmet expectations caused many of us to view the era negatively, when in fact we were in many ways better off than we thought.--From publisher description.","subjects":{}},

{"isbn":"9780393081817","title":"Boomerang : travels in the new Third World","author":"Michael Lewis","summary":"As Pogo once said, \"We have met the enemy and he is us.\" In this book the author offers a scathing assessment of fiscal blunders in foreign lands, and details how economic repercussions are sure to be felt on American soil. Financial bubbles grew and burst, not only in the U.S. but in countries as diverse as Iceland, Germany, and Greece. Mixing humor with prescient insight, he depicts a precarious situation that demands attention. The tsunami of cheap credit that rolled across the planet between 2002 and 2008 was more than a simple financial phenomenon: it was temptation, offering entire societies the chance to reveal aspects of their characters they could not normally afford to indulge. Icelanders wanted to stop fishing and become investment bankers. The Greeks wanted to turn their country into a piñata stuffed with cash and allow as many citizens as possible to take a whack at it. The Germans wanted to be even more German; the Irish wanted to stop being Irish. This investigation of bubbles beyond our shores is so sadly hilarious that it leads the American reader to a comfortable complacency: oh, those foolish foreigners. But when he turns a merciless eye on California and Washington, D.C., we see that the narrative is a trap baited with humor, and we understand the reckoning that awaits the greatest and greediest of debtor nations. - Publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Global Financial Crisis, 2008-2009."],"2":["International finance."],"3":["Financial crises","United States","History","21st century."],"4":["Erlebnisbericht.","(DE-588c)4133254-4","swd"],"5":["Finanzkrise.","(DE-588c)7635855-0","swd"],"6":["Kreditmarkt.","(DE-588c)4073788-3","swd"],"7":["Spekulative Blase.","(DE-588c)4450213-8","swd"],"8":["Staatsbankrott.","(DE-588c)4056637-7","swd"],"9":["Öffentliche Schulden.","(DE-588c)4043153-8","swd"],"10":["International economic relations.","sears"],"11":["Financial crises","United States","History.","sears"],"12":["Crise économique (2008).","ram"],"13":["Prêts hypothécaires à risque.","ram"]}},

In an eye-opening account, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the former spokesman of WikiLeaks, reveals never-disclosed details about the inner workings of the increasingly controversial organization that has struck fear into governments and business organizations worldwide and prompted the Pentagon to convene a 120-man task force.  In addition to Germany and the U.S., Inside WikiLeaks will be published simultaneously in 12 other countries.  Under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, Domscheit-Berg was the effective No. 2 at WikiLeaks and the organization's most public face, after Julian Assange.  In this book, he reveals the evolution, finances, and inner tensions of the whistleblower organization, beginning with his first meeting with Assange in December 2007.  He also describes what led to his September 2010 withdrawal from WikiLeaks, including his disenchantment with the organization's lack of transparency, its abandonment of political neutrality, and Assange's increasing concentration of power.  What has been made public so far about WikiLeaks is only a small fraction of the truth.  With Domscheit-Berg's insider knowledge, he is uniquely able to tell the full story.  A computer scientist who worked in IT security prior to devoting himself full-time to WikiLeaks, he remains committed to freedom of information on the Internet.  Today he is working on a more transparent secret-sharing website called OpenLeaks, developed by former WikiLeaks people, to be launched in early 2011.","subjects":{"1":["Web sites","Political aspects."],"2":["Leaks (Disclosure of information)"],"3":["Communication in politics."],"4":["Political corruption."],"5":["Whistle blowing","Political aspects."],"6":["Whistle blowing","Political aspects.","sears"],"7":["Web sites","Political aspects.","sears"],"8":["WikiLeaks","swd","(DE-101)1009760718","(DE-588c)7732453-5"]}},

A dead bird is found on the doorstep, a postage stamp bizarrely pinned to its beak. Hours later, Flavia finds a man lying in the cucumber patch and watches him as he takes his dying breath. For Flavia, who is both appalled and delighted, life begins in earnest when murder comes to Buckshaw. 'I wish I could say I was afraid, but I wasn't. Quite the contrary. This was by far the most interesting thing that had ever happened to me in my entire life.' To Flavia the investigation is the stuff of science: full of possibilities, contradictions, and connections. Soon her father, a man raising his three daughters alone, is seized, accused of murder. And in a police cell, during a violent thunderstorm, Colonel de Luce tells his daughter an astounding story - of a schoolboy friendship turned ugly, of a priceless object that vanished in a bizarre and brazen act of thievery, of a Latin teacher who flung himself to his death from the school's tower thirty years before. Now Flavia is armed with more than enough knowledge to tie two distant deaths together, to examine new suspects, and begin a search that will lead her all the way to the King of England himself.

White was obeying that oft repeated maxim: \"Write what you know.\" Helpless pigs, silly geese, clever spiders, greedy rats, White knew all of these characters in the barns and stables where he spent his favorite hours. Painfully shy his entire life, \"this boy,\" White once wrote of himself, \"felt for animals a kinship he never felt for people.\" It is all the more impressive, therefore, how many people have felt a kinship with E. B. White. With Charlotte's Web, which has gone on to sell more than 45 million copies, the man William Shawn called \"the most companionable of writers\" lodged his own character, the avuncular author, into the hearts of generations of readers.  In this book the author shows how White solved what critic Clifton Fadiman once called \"the standing problem of the juvenile fantasy writer: how to find, not another Alice, but another rabbit hole\" by mining the raw ore of his childhood friendship with animals in Mount Vernon, New York, translating his own passions and contradictions, delights and fears, into an all time classic. Blending White's correspondence with the likes of Ursula Nordstrom, James Thurber, and Harold Ross, the E. B. White papers at Cornell, and the archives of HarperCollins and the New Yorker into his own narrative, the author brings to life the shy boy whose animal stories, real and imaginery, made him famous around the world.","subjects":{"1":["Authors, American","20th century","Biography."],"2":["Children's stories","Authorship."],"3":["American authors","Biography.","sears"]}},

Still mourning the loss of his cherished wife and locked in a perilous almost-romance with his deputy, Pam Tibbs, a woman many decades his junior, Hackberry feeds off the deeds of evil men to keep his own demons at bay. When alcoholic ex-boxer Danny Boy Lorca witnesses a man tortured to death in the desert and reports it, Hack's investigation leads to the home of Anton Ling, a regal, mysterious Chinese woman whom the locals refer to as La Magdalena and who is known for sheltering illegals. Ling denies having seen the victim or the perpetrators, but there is something in her steely demeanor and aristocratic beauty that compels Hackberry to return to her home again and again as the investigation unfolds. Could it be that the sheriff is so taken in by this creature who reminds him of his deceased wife that he would ignore the possibility that she is just as dangerous as the men she harbors? The danger in the desert increases tenfold with the return of serial murderer Preacher Jack Collins, whom The New York Times called \"one of Burke's most inspired villains.\" Presumed dead at the close of Rain Gods, Preacher Jack has reemerged with a calm, single-minded zeal for killing that is more terrifying than the muzzle flash of his signature machine gun. But this time he and Sheriff Holland have a common enemy. Praised by Joyce Carol Oates for \"the luminosity of his writerly voice,\" James Lee Burke returns with his most allegorical novel to date, illuminating vital issues of our time- -immigration, energy, religious freedom- with the rich atmosphere and devastatingly flawed, authentic characters that readers have come to celebrate during the five decades of his brilliant career. -- Book Jacket","subjects":{"1":["Sheriffs","Texas","Fiction."],"2":["Human trafficking","Fiction."],"3":["Missing persons","Fiction."]}},

The doctor's bizarre family, a few patients, and a pedophile living in the backyard shed completed the tableau. Here, there were no rules, there was no school.

The state police of Troop D in rural Pennsylvania have kept a secret in Shed B out back of the barracks ever since 1979, when Troopers Ennis Rafferty and Curtis Wilcox answered a call from a gas station just down the road and came back with an abandoned Buick Roadmaster. Curt Wilcox knew old cars, and he knew immediately that this one was ... wrong, just wrong. A few hours later, when Rafferty vanished, Wilcox and his fellow troopers knew the car was worse than dangerous -- and that it would be better if John Q. Public never found out about it. Curt's avid curiosity taking the lead, they investigated as best they could, as much as they dared. Over the years the troop absorbed the mystery as part of the background to their work, the Buick 8 sitting out there like a still life painting that breathes -- inhaling a little bit of this world, exhaling a little bit of whatever world it came from. In the fall of 2001, a few months after Curt Wilcox is killed in a gruesome auto accident, his 18-year-old boy Ned starts coming by the barracks, mowing the lawn, washing windows, shoveling snow. Sandy Dearborn, Sergeant Commanding, knows it's the boy's way of holding onto his father, and Ned is allowed to become part of the Troop D family. One day he looks in the window of Shed B and discovers the family secret. Like his father, Ned wants answers, and the secret begins to stir, not only in the minds and hearts of the veteran troopers who surround him, but in Shed B as well.","subjects":{"1":["Abandonment of automobiles","Fiction."],"2":["Police","Pennsylvania","Fiction."],"3":["Buick automobile","Fiction."],"4":["Teenage boys","Fiction."],"5":["Pennsylvania-Fiction."],"6":["Buick automobile-Fiction."],"7":["Police-Pennsylvania-fiction."],"8":["Teenage boys-Fiction."],"9":["Abandonment of automobiles-Fiction."]}},

{"isbn":"9780061836923","title":"Moonlight mile","author":"Dennis Lehane","summary":"Amanda McCready was four years old when she vanished from a Boston neighborhood twelve years ago. Desperate pleas for help from the child's aunt led investigators Kenzie and Gennaro to take on the case. The pair risked everything to find the young girl, only to orchestrate her return to a neglectful mother and a broken home. Now Amanda is sixteen and gone again. A stellar student, brilliant but aloof, she seemed destined to escape her upbringing. Yet Amanda's aunt is once more knocking on Patrick Kenzie's door, fearing the worst for the little girl who has blossomed into a striking, clever young woman, a woman who hasn't been seen in weeks. Haunted by their consciences, Kenzie and Gennaro revisit the case that troubled them the most. Their search leads them into a world of identity thieves, methamphetamine dealers, a mentally unstable crime boss and his equally demented wife, a priceless, thousand-year-old cross, and a happily homicidal Russian gangster.

He was not only involved in the struggle against intolerance, he was obsessed with it\" are the words used to describe the now world famous author Stieg Larsson by his friend and close colleague, Kurdo Baksi, who himself was a prominent character in The Millennium Trilogy. During Larsson's career as a journalist he was a crucial figure in the battle against racism and for democracy in Sweden as one of the founders of the anti fascist magazine Expo. The author first met Larsson in 1992, triggering an intense friendship and a fruitful, but challenging, working relationship.  In this candid memoir, the author answers the questions a multitude of Larsson's fans have already asked about his childhood, the recurring death threats, his insomnia, his vices, and his feminism, so evident in his books, as well as his own personal dogma. What was he like as an individual and author? Who provided the inspiration for his now immortal characters (Baksi is one of the few who appears in the trilogy as himself), and of course, who was Lisbeth Salander?","subjects":{"1":["Authors, Swedish","20th century","Biography."],"2":["Journalists","Sweden."],"3":["Swedish novelists","Biography.","sears"],"4":["Journalists","Sweden","Biography.","sears"],"5":["Svenska författare","2000-talet","biografi.","sao"]}},

{"isbn":"9781451648539","title":"Steve Jobs","author":"Walter Isaacson","summary":"This is the exclusive biography of Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues the author has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.","subjects":{"1":["Computer engineers","United States","Biography."],"2":["Businesspeople","United States","Biography."],"3":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Business.","bisacsh"],"4":["BUSINESS & ECONOMICS / General.","bisacsh"],"5":["TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / General.","bisacsh"],"6":["Businessmen","United States","Biography.","sears"],"7":["Computer industry","United States","Biography.","sears"],"8":["Computer engineers","United States","Biography."],"9":["Businesspeople","United States","Biography."]}},

Along the way, she reminds us why, after millions of years, sharks remain among nature's most awe-inspiring creatures. From Belize to South Africa, from Shanghai to Bimini, sharks are still the object of an obsession that may eventually lead to their extinction. This is why movie stars and professional athletes go shark hunting in Miami, and why shark's fin soup remains a coveted status symbol in China. Yet people and sharks can exist alongside one another: surfers tolerate their presence off Cape Town and ecotourists swim with sharks that locals in the Yucataǹ no longer have to hunt.

The biggest earthquake in Japan's history-and one of the world's five most powerful since 1900-devastated the Tohoku region, 320 kilometers (200 miles) northeast of Tokyo.  It triggered a huge tsunami that left crippling damage in its wake.  More than 13,000 people drowned, and thousands of buildings and homes were reduced to rubble.  As people assessed the damage, they made the most frightening discovery of all:  the Fukushima #1 nuclear power plant was seriously damaged and three of its six reactors were heading for meltdowns.  Workers tried desperately-but unsuccessfully-to save them.  Explosions and fires released radioactivity into the air.  Within days the Japanese government declared a 20-kilometer (12-mile) evacuation zone.

{"isbn":"9781451625349","title":"A hole at the bottom of the sea : the race to kill the BP oil gusher","author":"Joel Achenbach","summary":"It was a technological crisis in an alien realm: a blown-out oil well in mile-deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. For the engineers who had to kill the well, this was like Apollo 13, a crisis no one saw coming, and one of untold danger and challenge. A suspense story, a mystery, a technological thriller: This is the author's account of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and what came after. The tragic explosion on the huge drilling rig in April 2010 killed eleven men and triggered an environmental disaster. As a gusher of crude surged into the Gulf's waters, BP engineers and government scientists, awkwardly teamed in Houston, raced to devise ways to plug the Macondo well. The author moves beyond the blame game to tell the gripping story of what it was like, behind the scenes, moment by moment, in the struggle to kill Macondo. Here are the controversies, the miscalculations, the frustrations, and ultimately the technical triumphs of men and women who worked out of sight and around the clock for months to find a way to plug the well. The Deepwater Horizon disaster was an environmental 9/11. The government did not have the means to solve the problem; only the private sector had the tools, and it didn't have the right ones as the country became haunted by Macondo's black plume, which was omnipresent on TV and the Internet. Remotely operated vehicles, the spaceships of the deep, had to perform the challenging technical maneuvers on the seafloor. Engineers choreographed this robotic ballet and crammed years of innovation into a single summer. As he describes the drama in Houston, the author probes the government investigation into what went wrong in the deep sea. This was a confounding mystery, an engineering whodunit. The lessons of this tragedy can be applied broadly to all complex enterprises and should make us look more closely at the highly engineered society that surrounds us. This is a cautionary tale that doubles as a technological thriller. -- Provided by publisher.","subjects":{"1":["Offshore oil well drilling","Technological innovations."],"2":["Oil well cementing."],"3":["Technology and state","United States."],"4":["BP Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill, 2010."],"5":["Offshore oil well drilling","Political aspects","United States."],"6":["HISTORY","General.","bisacsh"],"7":["SCIENCE","General.","bisacsh"],"8":["TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING","General.","bisacsh"],"9":["BP Deepwater Horizon Explosion and Oil Spill, 2010.","sears"],"10":["Offshore oil well drilling","Political aspects.","sears"],"11":["Technology and civilization","United States.","sears"],"12":["Offshore oil well drilling","Technological innovations.","sears"]}},
